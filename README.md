# Snowflake-Insurance-ML-Pipeline

The purpose of this project was to create a Machine Learning Pipeline in Snowflake. <br>
Data I used was the popular kaggle [insurance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sridharstreaks/insurance-data-for-machine-learning/data). <br>
The result is a website available at the [link](https://app-insurance-ml-pipe.streamlit.app/)

## The site
### Predicied vs actual
On the site you can see a scatterplot showing the actual vs predicted charges <br>

<br>
### Get your own prediction
Also, you can enter your data, or any other data you would like to check the predicted value for and get the prediction <br>
